An ASP page that can be used on a server to provide a "command line shell"-like experience when opening it in a webbrowser.

Simply put the index.asp file on a server and open the url to the file in a browser to see the command line interface.

Features:
  * Looks almost identical to cmd.exe output.
  * Shows all previous output when executing additional commands.
  * Command history available by pressing up/down arrow keys.
  * Allows up/download of files.
